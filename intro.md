# The Arts Engagement Project

The Arts Engagement Project is a study of ~4000 undergraduate students at the University of Michigan that asked questions about the impacts, precursors, barriers, frequency, and perceptions of co-curricular arts engagement in college. 

## Methods
Drawing from a subset of open-ended questions and responses, we created ontological topic models for each question and an interactive decision support tool to facilitate collaborative interpretation of the topics. We also measured a variety of linguistic and psychographic factors associated with the responses using three different dictionary-based tools. We then combined these measures with the measures of topic prevalence in a principal components analysis to explore the relationships between the topics, tone, and structure of the responses. 

## Implications
The results — particularly when coupled with an analysis of their relationship the demographic profiles of the respondents — provided important insights for the design of arts-based experiences in higher education, as well as the impacts of the arts on student learning and engagement. 

## Future Project Development
This project studied only University of Michigan Students, but the study design and analysis methods could be used on other campuses to look at a broader range of students and their arts experiences. For instance, arts administrators in higher education may be interested in partnering with us, creating a larger network of research projects on this topic. We are currently documenting this project, describing the workflows used to develop the insights here, and possibly developing  an end-to-end workflow for quickly making sense of large collections of interviews, recording, or open-ended survey responses about emerging topics. 

The results of this work have been used to add an array of categories of impacts to [A2RU's Impacts Map.](https://www.a2ru.org/projects/impacts-map/)
