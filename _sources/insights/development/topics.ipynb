    "\n",
    "This question asked about the role that the arts played in relational terms – to self, and to self in interaction with others. Broadly, these impacts around development of self fall along two main branches: **Social Identity**  and **Different Perspectives**. The topic **Social Connections** indicated new and strengthened social bonds and supporting friends by attending and participating in arts activities. Students also reported growth or change in the areas of **Personal Identity**, **Skill Acquisition**, **New Perspectives and Cultural Understandings**, **Better Life Balance**, and, as might be expected, a **Deeper Appreciation of the Arts**. Tken together, this array of topics suggest a significant pro-social role for the the arts in the students' social (and skill) development."

    "## Social Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "This node of responses focuses on the impact of the arts in college on Social Connections and on Identity. There were multiple impacts in the category of Social Connections.  Supporting friends in their artistic endeavors is a way to both maintain relationships through mutual interests in the arts as well as to share and take pride in friends’ creative endeavors and accomplishments. Having these relationships supported through arts attendance helped students maintain balance in their academic lives. The primary effect on Identity was the arts’ contribution to students’ personal and professional lives, the way they view themselves, or their pursuit of their life-long goals. In some cases, the arts come to play an integral role.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Social Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "To be included in this node, responses typically included the word “friend,” and described either attending arts events with friends, supporting friends engaged themselves in arts events or activities, or gaining or maintaining friendships (social bonds) through mutual interests centered around the arts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengthened Social Bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical responses in this impact area include expressions of the importance of attending arts events with friends or supporting friends in their arts activities as a way for friendships to become closer.  There was also the observation of being closer to friends who were involved in the arts, or that those friends were valuable to their broader college experiences or in developing new perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This differs from the reported Supported Friends section in that these reported impacts focus on becoming “closer” to existing friends through the arts rather than the personal enjoyment or enrichment that supporting friends in their arts interests engenders.  This section also speaks to developing a greater respect or appreciation of their friends’ skills, commitment and creativity through the shared interest in their arts participation.\n",

Increased my appreciation for individuals with similar interest in arts. which led to me choosing certain friends over others as the ones to spend time with. Focused my studies on writing as a student as opposed to on another subject.”\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Supported Friends\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of reported impacts described the opportunities for and  importance of supporting friends involved in the arts through attendance at arts activities. This support provided enjoyment through the arts, as well as appreciation for the opportunity to support their friends in something that was important to them.\n",

    "This node differs from Strengthened Social Bonds in that these reported impacts focus on the more personal enjoyment of the shared activities and the rewards that come from both being a good friend and exploring your friends’ interests.\n",

    "### Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses in the area of Identity have been split into three nodes – those responses that describe how engaging with the arts changed the way they view themselves (Became Part of Identity), impacted specific skills and abilities (Played a Developmental Role), or had little or no effect on their development in college (Didn’t Play a  Role).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For those responses where students indicated that the arts led to changes in their identity, behavior, or abilities (Became Part of Identity), these changes are reported as overwhelmingly positive, and typically the response includes more than one area of reported change. \n",
    " \n",
    "In Played a Developmental Role, students reported areas they personally developed with more specific descriptive skills or attributes, rather than or in addition to  comments about their more overarching identity, behavior or life changes.  These areas included things like critical thinking, psychological and social well-being, discipline, respect, open-mindedness, cultural awareness, communication, confidence and expression.\n",
    " \n",
    "In the responses indicating the arts Didn’t Play a Role in their development in college, there was either no connection made between the arts and their development, or there was an indication that there might have been a role if there had been time for participation.  These latter responses also sometimes indicated regret at not having been involved in the arts more in college, sometimes linked to concerns that increased participation in college arts might have distracted from career preparation and job success. \n",

    "#### Didn’t Play a  Role\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses in this node typically indicate that students could make little or no connection between their arts engagement in college and their development. This could have been a simple statement (without indication of their level of participation in the arts), or could indicate that their limited participation may have been a reason there was no particular impact. There were also statements of regret around their limited college arts participation, with the reported reasons being insufficient time or a perceived choice between arts involvement and a school/career focus. \n",

    " \n",
    "> “I feel like I did most of the same things and acted the same ways as I did in high school, but in a more defined way due to living in a city that accommodates better to it with wider opportunities. I also feel regret for not doing more of it.”\n",
