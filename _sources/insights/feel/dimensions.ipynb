    "\n",
    "A total of 24 variables and 654 responses were included in the analysis of responses to the question, *“How did your involvement in the arts during college make you feel?”* Eight components overall had an eigenvalue greater than 1, explaining a cumulative 70% of the variation. Five components explaining a cumulative 56% of the variation were extracted for description. Each dimension is characterized by distributions of responses that illustrate different themes that may sometimes in tension with each other. Each of these dimensions is described in more detail in the sections below. \n",

    "In addition, we tested for demographic patterns in the responses along each dimension, by conducting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey posthoc test to compare the principal component scores between demographic factor levels. Demographic variables that showed contrasts (Tukey adj.p.value < 0.05) between factor levels indicated differences that are unlikely to be due to chance. These differences may suggest an association between the direction of the demographic factors difference and the areas of emotional impact described by the accompanying dimension/principal component.   \n",

    "Demographic factor level contrasts were observed for Dimensions 2, 3, 4, and 5. Dimensions 2, 4, and 5 each showed an association with High School Arts Frequency (`hs_arts_freq`). `sr_participated` and `artsincollege` also showed contrasts for Dimension 2, suggesting a firm role of prior exposure to the arts for Dimension 2. High School Location (`hslocation`) and `so_childhood5` differences emerged for for Dimension 3. Demographic factors that had associations with each of the dimensions are listed below, along with statistical tables and accompanying figures illustrating the contrasts between factor levels.
