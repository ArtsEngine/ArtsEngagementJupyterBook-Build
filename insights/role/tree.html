<p>This is a structural topic model visualization, with hierarchical topic clusters. Topic branches that are more likely to co-occur together in a single response are clustered together since each response often contains a mixture of multiple topics. We inferred the topic for each of the parent nodes using the leaf node topics and working towards the base of the tree from right to left. Category descriptions become more general towards the base of the tree and more specific towards the leaves. Prevalence is also reflected in the visual weight of the branches helping show the relative proportion of topics. It is important to keep in mind too that the proportions of topics may be different for different groups, but that the overall types are topics may be more stable across sampled populations. The leaf node topic prevalences are directly estimated, while the parent topic prevalences are a summation of their children/leaf topics. Because of rounding, the total topic prevalance may add up to slightly more than 100%.</p>
