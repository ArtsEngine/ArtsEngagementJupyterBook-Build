    "\n",
    "A total of 27 variables and 3852 responses were included in the principal component analysis of responses to the question, ***“What did you see as the barriers preventing you from being involved in the arts at the University of Michigan (if you experienced any)?”***. A scree plot, dimension eigenvalues, and a loadings table for the variables included in the analysis follow at the bottom of this page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Five dimensions *(or, interchangeably, principal components)* explaining a cumulative 51% of the variation were extracted for further description and analysis. Each dimension is characterized by distributions of responses that illustrate different themes that may sometimes in tension with each other. Each of these dimensions is described in more detail in the sections below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Demographic Contrasts Results Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we tested for demographic patterns in the responses along each dimension, by conducting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukey posthoc test to compare the principal component scores between demographic factor levels. Demographic variables that showed contrasts (Tukey adj.p.value < 0.05) between factor levels indicated differences that are unlikely to be due to chance. These differences may suggest an association between the direction of the demographic factors difference and the barriers described by the accompanying dimension/principal component.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis revealed demographic factor level differences for Dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 5. Dimension 3 (*Dialectical Complexity*) showed no relationship with any of the demographic factors included in the analysis. There were `school` and `income` differences for Dimension 1. Differences for `sex` emerged for Dimensions 2, 4, and 5. Prior exposure to the arts was particularly relevant for Dimensions 2 and 4. Demographic factors that had associations with each of the dimensions are listed below, along with statistical tables and accompanying figures illustrating the contrasts between factor levels. A brief description accompanies each dimension to summarize the results. \n",

    "\n",
    "Dimension 1 (the first principal component) explains about 18% of the variation among responses to the `barriers` question, and this dimension is characterized by responses focused on ***Personal Capacity*** in one direction, and by responses about ***Climate of Exclusion*** in the other direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Personal Capacity*** is the label given to describe one direction of this dimension; it is a synthesis of the topic variables of `Time` and `Course Load`, and the LIWC measurement `LIWC.relativ`, a spatial language variable indicative of location. Taken together, this direction of the dimension describes personal capacity either in terms of time, logistical effort (i.e. travel), interest, and priorities as a barrier to participating in the arts activities. Many responses indicated that their academic course load was too great (sometimes in conjunction with other more highly prioritized activities), to be involved in the arts at college. Location was also an issue, as the demands of traveling and being in multiple places often diminishes one's personal capacity.\n",

I went to the first practice and I didn’t find it as fun because the first day the people in my section were very competitive and it made me not want to join because I experienced enough competition in classes.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Climate of Exclusion*** describes the other direction of this dimension, synthesizing the topic variables `Unwelcoming Environment`, `Competitive Auditions`, `University Priorities`, `Accessibility`, and `Departmental Segregation`. Responses in the direction of this dimension reflect a direct and interpersonal sense of exclusion, characterized by competitive auditions and unwelcoming environments. Institutional signals of exclusion were also common among these responses, driven in part by the perception of inequitable funding, attention and pride across programs, inability to access arts courses offered outside their school, and the need to actively seek out information about arts events, creating accessibility problems.\n",
    "\n",
    ">“The art department doesn’t let you use the studios unless you are taking a class in that studio.”\n",
    "\n",
    ">“I wanted to be in an acapella group and had tried out for 4-5 my sophomore and freshman year. I got called back from two different groups but didn’t make it from there. It was hard because I really wanted to be in an acapella group and not in a choir, so therefore I haven’t gotten to sing here, which makes me sad.”\n",
    "\n",
    ">“The great and sad part of UM is the wealth of talented individuals who go here-- makes it hard for me, a moderately talented individual in a number of fields, to try out for a play or musical group and actually make it because I’m competing with, for example, percussion majors for Groove and theatre majors for a part in a play.”\n",

This suggests two things. First, prior exposure in the arts appears to have a strong, underlying impact on whether students are likely to cite ***Other Interests*** as a barrier to arts involvement. The second is that multiple factors impact prior experiences in the arts, from childhood exposure, to availability, encouragement, and actual participation.  \n",

    "Dimension 4 explains about 7% of the variation among responses to the `barriers` question, and this dimension is characterized by responses focused on **Lack of Personal Interest, Confidence, & Familiarity** in one direction, and by responses about **Distance Between Campuses & Awareness** in the other direction.

However, the main difference between dimensions 4 and 5 appears to be a distinction between barriers linked to factors that individual students have some control over (in the case of **Lack of Personal Interest, Confidence, and/or Familiarity** in Dimension 4) and factors that may be more institutionally driven (in the case of **Course Availability** in Dimension 5). \n",
