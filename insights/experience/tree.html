<p>This tree map shows the distribution of topics among the responses to the question, <em><strong>“Please describe any transformative or meaningful arts experience you have had during college.”</strong></em>. It contains 17 topics, and 1043 responses. The topics identified are located at the ends of the braches, also called leaf nodes, and the branching nodes are topic clusters, or parent nodes. The numbers are the total prevalence (0-100%) of the topic or cluster as a percentage all the documents/responses.</p>

Both have shown me the creativity that goes into the arts and how the artsallows such free expression.","I saw Wilco at Hill Auditorium and Grizzly Bear at the Michigan Theater last year...both of those were beyond meaningful.  Both of Those music groups have such an absurdly powerful way of transforming a music performance into a collective experience for te audience.  In a weird sense, for those few hours you felt totally connected with everyone else because you were all experiencing the same beautiful, loud, complex thing hitting your brain.

The University of Michigan Educational Theater Company transformed my life during orientation because I loved it!","Watching a play on Anne Frank.","One of my classes had a unit on the basics of guitar in which we were offered university instruments to play and borrow.  I became incredibly interested in the guitar and began to take one of the university guitars home more often.  I got a lot of supportfrom my professor to continue learning and practicing.

I honestly felt like I had never experienced Shakespeare the right way until I watched this group, and I felt more emotions than I knew what to do with.

It was for a class, and I never pursued it outside of class, but it gave me such a sense of empowerment and confidence, and I felt really comfortable and capable.","i've been able to play outside of ann arbor with bands, something I missed more in high school","The marching band has been pretty cool, but hasn't been as meaningful as my involvement in band in high school. I grew more and was more impressed by my involvement in the arts in high school than I have been in college, unfortunately. I find it meaningfu to perform every Saturday in front of 110,000 people, but not as meaningful as some may think","Singing in church choir, engineering building","Being in the MMB is pretty transformational. I am in the band sorority and know so much about myself.","Playing my flute during my second year here - I didn't realize how much I missed that method of personal expression.

I was enrolled in a Creative Writing class for about two weeks last winter semester (I had to drop it becauseI was overwhelmed with my other courses) and, during this time, I was struggling with depression and other emotional issues and, though I was only in the Creative Writing class for a few weeks, it acted as a sort of therapy for me (although I had been wriing before the Creative Writing class).","I went to London for Spring Break with the Helicon Art History Club and learned alot and saw alot of amazing art.","Writing the first draft of a book I thought up of","I was in college when I saw my first interesting installation artwork (though not at school). That broadened my understanding of art environments.","singing","participating in the MMB","I participated as a writer for \"24 Hour Theatre\" as part of the Basement Arts season. It was amazing! Although I was bloody tired by the end of it, I felt a lot more confident about what I was capable of as a writer.","My first marching band performance!  I thought it was incredible to be combining music with the marching designs on the field.","I am taking the Stamps Lecture Series course though the school of art and design.","The Russian Opera was pretty cool, but nothing \"transformative.\"","With GIEU, we taught art to elementary/middle school kids in Detroit for a week.  The kids had never had an art class before and it was really great seeing how much they enjoyed it and thrived.","Participating in campus band was incredible, as well as doing lights for a Basement Arts production and a Salto production.","Although it is more on the academic side of the arts, discovering the field of musicology has definitely given me a new outlook on my role in the music world. I've never been particularly good in terms of my performance skills as a musician, but being a god music scholar in my classes gave me a new, more meaningful role in music; I began to feel as though I could really contribute something positive to the field of music.","Not many, aside from learning to play harmonica and jamming with a full band. That was pretty magical.","Choreographing pieces for each our semester shows has been a very meaningful experience, because it has allowed me to creatively express myself and develop an actual concrete product. Actually, playing a larger role in putting on a full-scale dance show hs really been meaningful. I've grown much more as a dancer in college, though maybe not technically, but more creatively, than I did in high school or middle school.","I am involved in a club that shows movies, which has made me much more aware of film as a type of art. Before, I only thought of movies as entertainment and didn't really think about how they were made.","i loved being a part of Collage through the school of music.","The Kelsey Museum has a lot of great artifacts and interesting exhibits.

It was a very different style than the jazz I'd heard in the past before, but it made me think about what art is and what music is. Despite initially finding the jazz only alrigt, the more I listened, the more I enjoyed it. I found it to be a very multi-faceted performance.","I've taken Jazz courses through the school of music for the last 2 years and these courses mainly focus on the contemplative practices within meditation.

<p>This is a structural topic model visualization, with hierarchical topic clusters. Topic branches that are more likely to co-occur together in a single response are clustered together since each response often contains a mixture of multiple topics. We inferred the topic for each of the parent nodes using the leaf node topics and working towards the base of the tree from right to left. Category descriptions become more general towards the base of the tree and more specific towards the leaves. Prevalence is also reflected in the visual weight of the branches helping show the relative proportion of topics. It is important to keep in mind too that the proportions of topics may be different for different groups, but that the overall types are topics may be more stable across sampled populations. The leaf node topic prevalences are directly estimated, while the parent topic prevalences are a summation of their children/leaf topics. Because of rounding, the total topic prevalance may add up to slightly more than 100%.</p>
