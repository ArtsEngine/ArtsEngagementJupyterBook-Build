I am good at keeping to myself and being in my own little world, but music, arts, expression all help to connect people with one another and engage our eotions and passions.","I think that people are able to grow through the arts because it provides a needed outlet not only for personal expression of identity, values, and beliefs, but for connecting with one another. Arts are something that require no common language, experiencs, or backgrounds, and people across communities can coexist and learn from one another through the arts.","As I said before, it can bring you to value the abstract ideals that life has to offer, rather than just the materialistic things that so many people tend to value these days.","You can broaden your horizons and come to appreciate people with different talents and interests, as well as the lives people live in other cultures (even within the same country).","You can learn about history and what certain people enjoy.","The arts offer a new lens with which to view different people's experiences and perspectives, and getting a glimpse through that lens can only offer more knowledge about the world and all the people in it.","Can gain creativity, will also be able to meet new people that are different from the traditional business people I always hang out with and they can give me a different perspective on things","To be honest I'm not sure what grow means. I'm not sure the practical implications but I think you can meet people and connect with others the same way you could with sports or any other interest.","I can become a more fullu-realized person by engaging in the arts. By learning how other people express themselves through art, I can learn how to connect with people and learn to better express myself."],"thought_proportions":[0.3099,0.3075,0.2795,0.2592,0.2449,0.2157,0.2146,0.2078,0.2052],"prob":["peopl, can, also, connect, believ, histori, valu"],"frex":["connect, believ, peopl, valu, histori, also, engag"],"lift":["percept, connect, engag, believ, live, littl, general"],"score":["percept, peopl, also, connect, histori, believ, valu"],"proportion":["0.06"]},{"name":["Exposure to New Experiences"],"summary":["Another way students indicated they could grow through the arts was by gaining Exposure to New Experiences.

And just like so many other great things, you don't have compare your accomplishments to others. Rather, just by doing the arts, you can always get better.","Learn more about different cultures and different art forms. There is always something new and exciting coming out so there is always new information to be absorbed.","you learn new things about yourself when you expose yourself in art","i think you can grow in every way by trying new things and seeing how you react to them","it increases your powers of observation allowing you see things in life that you may pass over normally","You can diversify your interests - there are so many things to choose from, and I think there's something out there for almost everyone.  It's a chance to express yourself in a way you wouldn't normally.","It just gives you a broader mindset and makes you think about things in many different ways.","The arts can always inspire new thoughts and emotions. The arts can inspire you to do something or be something creative that you would never have been otherwise.","Personally and in your perspective and outlook toward life. Art gives you a more full-circle depiction of life and yourself. Art allows you to be introspective and understand things in new and exciting ways.","I think that my participation in the arts can always increase.  I love taking dance classes and learning new kinds of dance and skills.","In many- if you stop growing, you are dead.","how someone chooses to show/express things can give you a new viewpoint","Well in dance we partner a lot so we have to be understand, supportive, trusting and giving people... otherwise it just doesn't work that well.","I have developed an appreciation for Irish culture through my participation on the Irish dance team.  I have also developed socially by developing bonds with a diverse group of students.","Developing an appreciation for diversity and for others' cultures and histories. I think exposing yourself to the arts is a great way to see the world from different perspectives.","I think it makes you more cultured, you learn about so many new things through the arts","I think you can see things through others' perspectives and remain open minded and receptive to new ideas.","It develops my ability to see situations from different perspectives.","As I said before, it can bring you to value the abstract ideals that life has to offer, rather than just the materialistic things that so many people tend to value these days.","in every way possible. i met people i never would have otherwise and was exposed to so much more.","Just open another door of my life and learn something new. I've never really done anything with the arts so with more time after graduation it could be an interesting thing to get involved in.","You can learn about new things, you can enjoy creating something new, you can learn how to work with other people to create something, you can learn to appreciate other opinions about art.","I said it in the previous question--but just being self-aware is a huge step in growing up and learning who you are.","Can gain creativity, will also be able to meet new people that are different from the traditional business people I always hang out with and they can give me a different perspective on things","The arts can expand my worldview and introduce me to new ideas I would otherwise not be exposed to","You can learn more about cultures through their arts, and you can find something that you're excited about and really enjoy in the many many art realms.","I think that they would be exposed to different people and cultures and organizations that they wouldn't be interacting with otherwise.","Connecting to people I otherwise wouldn't hang out with\r\n\r\nIncreased concentration/focus/creativity\r\n\r\n","Creativity, being more open-minded about things, exploring new cultures.","It opens you up to new perspectives. That is good.","It introduces a new and different perspective.  I always enjoy listening to others' ideas and experiencing their talents.","I think being involved in the arts, or at least in my case with music, I've been able to grow because it's a good time to just be quiet and reflect and I think parts of myself come out in my music.","Confidence booster just knowing you can learn a new instrument, fascinate people in a photograph, or wow people with a poem. It brings people closer together and I needed that during college.

<p>This is a structural topic model visualization, with hierarchical topic clusters. Topic branches that are more likely to co-occur together in a single response are clustered together since each response often contains a mixture of multiple topics. We inferred the topic for each of the parent nodes using the leaf node topics and working towards the base of the tree from right to left. Category descriptions become more general towards the base of the tree and more specific towards the leaves. Prevalence is also reflected in the visual weight of the branches helping show the relative proportion of topics. It is important to keep in mind too that the proportions of topics may be different for different groups, but that the overall types are topics may be more stable across sampled populations. The leaf node topic prevalences are directly estimated, while the parent topic prevalences are a summation of their children/leaf topics. Because of rounding, the total topic prevalance may add up to slightly more than 100%.</p>
