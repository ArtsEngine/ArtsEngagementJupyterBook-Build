<h1>Self-Fulfillment<a class="headerlink" href="#self-fulfillment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Growth through encountering new experiences and people (external to self), through the acquisition of new competencies (demonstrable self skills), and the development of cognitive and emotional complexity (internal to self) combined with the ability to fully explore and exploit this growth. All of this helped students to discover and understand themselves as they moved down the path of maturity and change that leads to Self-Fulfillment.</p>
<div class="section" id="experiencing-the-new">
<h2>Experiencing the New<a class="headerlink" href="#experiencing-the-new" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>New people, new connections, new ideas - this growth through  Experiencing the New was an important response area in asking about how students believed they could grow through the arts.  They were  Connecting with People in New Ways and having Exposure to New Experiences, as you would expect with the wide variety of offerings and resources afforded them in the culturally and intellectually diverse environment of the university.</p>
<div class="section" id="connect-with-people-in-new-ways">
<h3>Connect with People in New Ways<a class="headerlink" href="#connect-with-people-in-new-ways" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Under the topic of Connect with People in New Ways, students report that the arts gave them increased opportunities to both understand other’s values and perspectives and to meet people they would not have otherwise encountered.</p>
<p><strong>Representative Quotes</strong></p>
<p>*“Personally, it’s made me see that it’s a way to engage with people in a way I never would’ve thought. I am good at keeping to myself and being in my own little world, but music, arts, expression all help to connect people with one another and engage our emotions and passions.”</p>
<p>“I think that people are able to grow through the arts because it provides a needed outlet not only for personal expression of identity, values, and beliefs, but for connecting with one another. Arts are something that require no common language, experiences, or backgrounds, and people across communities can coexist and learn from one another through the arts.”</p>
<p>“The arts offer a new lens with which to view different people’s experiences and perspectives, and getting a glimpse through that lens can only offer more knowledge about the world and all the people in it.”</p>
<p>“Can gain creativity, will also be able to meet new people that are different from the traditional business people I always hang out with and they can give me a different perspective on things.”</p>
<p>“You can broaden your horizons and come to appreciate people with different talents and interests, as well as the lives people live in other cultures (even within the same country).”*</p>

<div class="section" id="exposure-to-new-experiences">
<h3>Exposure to New Experiences<a class="headerlink" href="#exposure-to-new-experiences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another way students indicated they could grow through the arts was by gaining Exposure to New Experiences. This exposure led to new thinking, new interactions, different perspectives, and the discovery of new interests, talents, and points of inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>Representative Quotes</strong></p>
<p>*“Grow in confidence, expose you to arts, people, or things you wouldn’t have been exposed to otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Explore new things that I have never learned about.”</p>
<p>“You can diversify your interests - there are so many things to choose from, and I think there’s something out there for almost everyone. It’s a chance to express yourself in a way you wouldn’t normally.”</p>
<p>“It just gives you a broader mindset and makes you think about things in many different ways.”</p>
<p>“The arts can always inspire new thoughts and emotions. The arts can inspire you to do something or be something creative that you would never have been otherwise.”*</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="personal-skills">
<h2>Personal Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#personal-skills" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Students describe the arts as a mechanism to develop Personal Skills, most specifically leadership, communication, discipline, responsibility, patience,  organization, teamwork and expression.  They also spoke about more individual growth in areas such as aesthetic development, beliefs, values, interests, relationship building, self understanding, and reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Representative Quotes</strong></p>
<p>*“I think that being involved in any organization teaches you a lot of valuable skills that are needed to enter the workforce; time management, conflict resolution, completing tasks to the set standard, fulfilling commitments.”</p>
<p>“Being involved in the arts teaches time management, patience, and discipline. These can all further a person’s growth through life.”</p>
<p>“It can help build relationships and character. It can teach discipline and responsibility, etc.”</p>

<p>“Personal development, arts appreciation, leadership, personal knowledge”</p>
<p>“Personal expression. The arts force you to reflect on yourself, what you’ve done in your life, how you feel about it, and what that means to you. I have yet to find another activity that forces you to do all of this like being in the Arts.”*</p>

<div class="section" id="intra-personal-growth">
<h2>Intra-Personal Growth<a class="headerlink" href="#intra-personal-growth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Improving the skills gained and taking opportunties presented through the arts, the Self Exploration is complementary to students becoming More Self Aware - giving them reflective insights into themselves.  These nodes together created a kind of feedback cycle - exploring self through arts experiences then reflecting on the outcomes to more deeply understand themselves lead to Intra-Personal growth.  Thinking and feeling - both cognitive and emotional growth - are expressed through the key words and description in the responses in this area.</p>

The arts offered a creative outlet, which resulted in self relaxation, discovery, and expression.  There were also reports of developing competencies, setting and accomplishing goals, and having a positive self image.</p>
<p><strong>Representative Quotes</strong></p>
<p>*“I used to play an instrument in high school, and it was very rewarding when hard work and dedication paid off as a medal or as many compliments after our shows. It demonstrated achieving goals and feeling good about your accomplishments.”</p>
<p>“Having the peace and solitude to paint whatever I feel like gives me time to relax and enjoy life.”</p>
<p>“It helps to develop a sense of character, and leaves me feeling more well-rounded. I get so sick of doing quantitative things all the time (for my major) it feels good to use the other side of my brain, and be able to be creative without the fear of messing up or being wrong.”</p>
<p>“You really find yourself through the arts. Traditional education will teach you and shape you, but through the arts you really get to find and define yourself.”</p>
<p>“It can get me to think outside the box, and to express myself. It seems like art is all about expression so it is a way to get out some stress and anger.”</p>
<p>“I think art provides a good balance to life. With the stress of my anticipated career choice, I will need time to do things for myself, for my own enjoyment. I think it will be just a wonderful way to reflect, to express, and to relax.”*</p>

<div class="section" id="more-self-aware">
<h3>More Self-Aware<a class="headerlink" href="#more-self-aware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>“Appreciation of the arts consists of a lot of self-reflection, and I think this is where we grow as people. You are seeking out arts that are meaningful to you, and I think that allows us to know more about who we are. I also think participation in the arts requires a lot of hard work and stamina, so you grow in those ways as well.”</p>
<p>“The arts can expand your thinking by increasing range of knowledge and allowing one to evaluate more opinions.”*</p>

<h2>Empathetic<a class="headerlink" href="#empathetic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
