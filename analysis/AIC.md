# Automated Integrative Complexity (AIC)

Automated Integrative Complexity (AIC) is designed to measure the Integrative Complexity (IC) of statements {% cite conway2014automated houck2014automated feist1994personality %}. With origins in social and political psychology research {% cite suedfeld1976revolutionary  sudfeld1992conceptual %}, IC measures the structural complexity of thinking and reasoning evident in a given statement in order to assess the level of cognitive differentiation and subsequent integration of idea elements pertaining to an issue {% cite conway2018integrative %}. Automated Integrative Complexity is a dictionary-based tool, available online through a service provided by Distill Analytics {% cite AIC %}. Although the dictionary and algorithms used by the service are not in the public domain, the methods for coding passages of text are described elsewhere {% cite conway2014automated houck2014automated baker1992manual %}. 

Integrative Complexity measures two elements: differentiation and integration. The AIC tool also includes measures for the type of complexity: dialectical and elaborative {% cite conway2008two conway2014automated %}. Dialectical complexity occurs when an author deals with opposing viewpoints or some other kind of tension; elaborative complexity occurs when complexity builds on a single dominant theme or perspective {% cite AICsupplement %}. For each type (IC, Dial, or Elab), the AIC tool provides an overall measure, as well as separate measure of integration and differentiation within each type. Statements that distinguish different dimensions, topics, themes, perspectives, objects, and practices from each other score higher on differentiation. Statements score higher on integration if those differentiated elements are somehow brought together or conceptually integrated to produce a new outcome. Scores greater than 3 indicate that a statement has gone beyond differentiation towards active integration of the concepts, perspectives, possibilities, or other dimensions {% cite baker1992manual %}. For example, consider the following responses to question “How do you define ‘the arts’?” along with their observed IC measures:

> “Creative Expression” (IC=1)

This example above is a simple label with no differentiation between different perspectives whatsoever. 

> “To me the arts include pretty much a little of everything. This is because ‘the arts’ aren't exactly a thing, more of a method of how something is perceived or altered.” (IC=1.5)

In this example, the respondent seems slightly more open, but the respondent uses a dominant rule that situates the arts as “a little of everything” without considering a possible alternative, for example, that the arts could be “exactly a thing.”

> “’The arts’” are a way to let out your creativity. They can encompass anything from drawing, painting, photography, jewelry making, sculpting, singing, dancing, theater, museums, playing an instrument, and many other ways in which you can use your creativity. They are not limited to what we may think of as ‘art’ like a painting or a drawing, but encompass music and many other outlets as well.” (IC=2)

In this example above, a list predominates and primarily reinforces the statement that “The arts are a way to let out your creativity.” Later in the statement, the respondent recognizes that the arts may not be limited to the list and could include “many other outlets as well.” This demonstrates in increased level of differentiation, with the respondent recognizing the potential for alternatives which are not elaborated on. 

> “I think the arts includes all forms of creative works, be it written, painted, or theater; although I also think that there is some distinction between amateur 'arts' and professional. The distinction between the two is more noticeable in urban areas, where both forms are around.” (IC=3)

While this statement lays out a general categorization (“all forms of creative works”), the respondent makes an additional allowance (“I also think”) of a distinction between amateur and professional. The statement goes further to describe how that distinction is more noticeable in urban areas (presumably compared to rural ones) and why that distinction is more noticeable (“both forms abound”).

> “The arts include anything that someone considers to be a beautiful contribution to society. Therefore, I would even consider some scientific fields artistic because of the exploratory and innovative aspects that exist in everyone's work. I do think that most people consider only music, art, and writing to be part of the arts, and I do believe those are more expressive arts aimed at being recognized by the public as artistic. But I believe physics demands an artistic eye.” (IC=3.5)

In the final example above, the statement takes a more integrative stance. A superordinate statement provides the lead. The author then considers some other fields and provides reasons for this, and at the same time, acknowledges what most other people consider to be true about the arts. The contrast among alternatives sets up a dialectic tension; there are reasons from both perspectives about what should the definition should encompass. 

In the above examples, the responses progressively increase in complexity from a simple label with no differentiation between different perspectives toward greater integration and complexity. While the survey asked **“How do YOU define ‘the arts’?”** [emphasis added] the latitude that a respondent takes to include alternatives and potentially integrate those alternatives into that definition is, in part, what AIC seeks to measure.
