# Docuscope LATs

Docuscope {% cite kaufer2004power ishizaki2012computer %} is a corpus-based rhetorical analysis tool and dictionary developed by to analyze rhetorical patterns in text, student writing, and interview transcripts. Docuscope searches texts for strings of words (including words, phrases and punctuation marks) that can be classified according to a series of rhetorical categories contained in the program’s dictionaries, called ‘Language Action Types’ (LATs), and counts the frequency of those LATs for each text. 

LATs range from the basic, with LATs such as ‘First Person’ (first-person singular pronouns: ‘I’, ‘me’ etc.), to the more conceptual — for example, Uncertainty uses words indicating uncertainty (e.g., maybe, perhaps); Sensory Language includes words that stir the senses (e.g., blue, textured), concrete things (e.g., table, chair), spatial relations (e.g., near to,  seated with), motions (e.g., run, jump), dialogue cues (e.g., ," he barked) and oral speech features (e.g., uh huh); Abstract Concepts is a category that includes a very large set of latin (tion, sion, ment, ogy) or greek (logy) suffixes and other patterns indicating abstract general concepts, like sociological or anthropological; Future refers to when the future is invoked; and Comparison includes words that indicate conceptual similarity and difference, like "more" or "fewer" {% cite docuscope %}.

The Docuscope version 3.21 (6/26/2012) dictionary is publicly available on the web through Github {% cite docuscope %}, and as an application for classifying text through the Visualizing English Print’s (VEP) web-based interface, Ubiquity {% cite ubiquity %}. More recent Docuscope versions provide a greater number of more detailed LATs, however the dictionaries and LAT descriptions are not publicly available making interpretation of the results difficult. LAT dictionary category descriptions for version 3.21 can be found in the Github repository {% cite docuscopeLATs %} There are 115 LATs in version 3.21 of Docuscope. When the document corpus is processed through Docuscope/Ubiquity, counts for each response text are tallied and exported as csv frequency counts for the LAT categories for further analysis.
