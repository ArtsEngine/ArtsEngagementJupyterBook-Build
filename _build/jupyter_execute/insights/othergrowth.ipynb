    "\n",
    "On the surveys, this 'othergrowth' question follows the question, *“What role did the arts play in your development as a person, friend, colleague, and student during college?”*. This question was specifically aimed at having students reflect further on what they might see as other ways they could grow through the arts. While we did get some areas of overlap, the character of these responses were more about personal and individual growth, and looking inward to more emotional, cognitive, and expressive areas of change. The additional question was to see if students were able to dig a little deeper, past what might be commonly expected growth areas (***Creativity, Expression, and Communication***) to those that might be more difficult to uncover or convey (***Self-Exploration*** and ***More Self-Aware***).\n",
