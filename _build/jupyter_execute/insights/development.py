> “Helped me develop patience, creativity in my approaches to problems, ability to articulate ideas about aesthetic qualities, ability to be in conflict with a friend without it being destructive to our friendship, and a greater sense of my personal responsibility in group endeavors.”

## Overview 

This question asked about the role that the arts played in relational terms – to self, and to self in interaction with others. Broadly, these impacts around development of self fall along two main branches: **Social Identity** and **Different Perspectives**. The topic **Social Connections** indicated new and strengthened social bonds and supporting friends by attending and participating in arts activities. Students also reported growth or change in the areas of **Personal Identity**, **Skill Acquisition**, **New Perspectives and Cultural Understandings**, **Better Life Balance**, and, as might be expected, a **Deeper Appreciation of the Arts**. Tken together, this array of topics suggest a significant pro-social role for the the arts in the students' social (and skill) development.

**Topic Model Results** 
We estimated a topic model with 10 topics, 812 open-ended responses, and a 322 word dictionary. (after removing stop words). The resulting topics are interpreted and described in the accompanying sections, and the responses reflect two major topic branches: **Social Identity** and **Different Perspectives**. The detailed methods for estimating the model can be found in the section on [Topic Modeling and Interpretation](../insights/analysis/topics.html).
