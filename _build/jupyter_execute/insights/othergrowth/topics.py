**Topic Model Results** 
We estimated a topic model with 11 topics, 971 open-ended responses, and a 286 word dictionary. (after removing stop words). The resulting topics are interpreted and described in the accompanying sections, and the responses reflect two major topic branches: **Self Fulfillment** and **Humanist Perspective**. The detailed methods for estimating the model can be found in the section on [Topic Modeling and Interpretation](../insights/analysis/topics.html).

# Self-Fulfillment

Growth through encountering new experiences and people (external to self), through the acquisition of new competencies (demonstrable self skills), and the development of cognitive and emotional complexity (internal to self) combined with the ability to fully explore and exploit this growth. All of this helped students to discover and understand themselves as they moved down the path of maturity and change that leads to Self-Fulfillment.  

## Experiencing the New

New people, new connections, new ideas - this growth through  Experiencing the New was an important response area in asking about how students believed they could grow through the arts.  They were  Connecting with People in New Ways and having Exposure to New Experiences, as you would expect with the wide variety of offerings and resources afforded them in the culturally and intellectually diverse environment of the university. 

### Connect with People in New Ways

Under the topic of Connect with People in New Ways, students report that the arts gave them increased opportunities to both understand other’s values and perspectives and to meet people they would not have otherwise encountered.

**Representative Quotes**

*“Personally, it's made me see that it's a way to engage with people in a way I never would've thought. I am good at keeping to myself and being in my own little world, but music, arts, expression all help to connect people with one another and engage our emotions and passions.”

“I think that people are able to grow through the arts because it provides a needed outlet not only for personal expression of identity, values, and beliefs, but for connecting with one another. Arts are something that require no common language, experiences, or backgrounds, and people across communities can coexist and learn from one another through the arts.”

“The arts offer a new lens with which to view different people's experiences and perspectives, and getting a glimpse through that lens can only offer more knowledge about the world and all the people in it.”

“You can broaden your horizons and come to appreciate people with different talents and interests, as well as the lives people live in other cultures (even within the same country).”*

Another way students indicated they could grow through the arts was by gaining Exposure to New Experiences. This exposure led to new thinking, new interactions, different perspectives, and the discovery of new interests, talents, and points of inspiration.

**Representative Quotes**

*“Grow in confidence, expose you to arts, people, or things you wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise.”

They also spoke about more individual growth in areas such as aesthetic development, beliefs, values, interests, relationship building, self understanding, and reflection.

“Personal expression. The arts force you to reflect on yourself, what you’ve done in your life, how you feel about it, and what that means to you. I have yet to find another activity that forces you to do all of this like being in the Arts.”*


## Intra-Personal Growth
		
Improving the skills gained and taking opportunties presented through the arts, the Self Exploration is complementary to students becoming More Self Aware - giving them reflective insights into themselves.  These nodes together created a kind of feedback cycle - exploring self through arts experiences then reflecting on the outcomes to more deeply understand themselves lead to Intra-Personal growth.  Thinking and feeling - both cognitive and emotional growth - are expressed through the key words and description in the responses in this area.  

### Self Exploration

Student respondents talk about the arts as enabling them to express or expand themselves in more ways or directions - both inwardly and outwardly.  They described opportunities for Self Exploration and being able to stretch themselves (“think outside the box”) without fear of judgement.

“You really find yourself through the arts. Traditional education will teach you and shape you, but through the arts you really get to find and define yourself.”

“It can get me to think outside the box, and to express myself. It seems like art is all about expression so it is a way to get out some stress and anger.”

“I think art provides a good balance to life. With the stress of my anticipated career choice, I will need time to do things for myself, for my own enjoyment. I think it will be just a wonderful way to reflect, to express, and to relax.”*
