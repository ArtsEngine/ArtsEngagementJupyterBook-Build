**Topic Model Results** 
We estimated a topic model with 14 topics, using 1207 open-ended responses and a 286 word dictionary (after removing stop words). The resulting topics are interpreted and described in the accompanying sections, and the responses reflect overwhelmingly positive outcomes, although there are sources of ambivalence as well.

## Summary of Topic Analysis Results

We estimated a topic model using 1207 open-ended responses, resulting in a 286 word dictionary (after removing stop words) and a model with 14 topics. The resulting topics are interpreted and described in the accompanying section on [Topic Descriptions](../insights/feel/topics.html). 

This question *“How did your involvement in the arts during college make you feel?”* was asked to elicit what the range of emotional responses to arts engagement in college might encompass for students. If the arts are an “expressive dialogue between the artist and the audience,” being able to articulate feelings associated with that engagement describes a whole universe of outcomes that may be associated with becoming more Enlightened. There are also negative emotions reported, such as being frustrated or discouraged, as art often deals with challenging subject matter, difficult mastery and technique challenges, and working with others under the conditions of fierce aesthetic direction and unrelenting deadlines.

Student respondents involved in the arts reported feelings of being empowered and fulfilled, successful and accomplished, connected and culturally aware, happy and entertained, balanced and expressive, grateful and meaningful, and refreshed and less stressed. There were also a large number of students who expressed some level of regret in having not participated in the arts in college to a greater extent.

## Summary of Principal Components Analysis Results

Five dimensions accounted for a cumulative 56% of the variation among the responses (n=654) around the ‘emotional impacts’ question. The five dimensions were extracted for further description and analysis, and each dimension is characterized by distributions of responses that illustrate different themes that may sometimes in tension with each other. Each of these dimensions is described in more detail in the [dimensions section.](../insights/feel/dimensions.html)

## Summary of Demographic Contrasts Results

The analysis revealed associations between demographic factor level contrasts for Dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 5. Dimension 3 (*Dialectical Complexity*) did not reveal any association with any of the demographic factors included in the analysis. There were 'school' and 'income' differences for Dimension 1. Differences for 'sex' emerged for Dimensions 2, 4, and 5. Prior exposure to the arts was particularly relevant for Dimensions 2 and 4. Demographic factors that had associations with each of the dimensions are described in more detail in the [demographics section.](../insights/barriers/demographics.html)
